          <h2>About me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          In 2022 I made the decision to radically change my career path. Coming
          from a veterinary background and having worked as an administrative,
          hostess and waitress, I decided to turn my career around by entering
          the full stack web development sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          This change represents not only a new professional path for me, but
          also a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Technology has
          always interested me and immersing myself in web development allows me
          to combine my creativity with problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have been in a constant process of learning and
          developing, exploring programming languages, frameworks and tools that
          allow me to create efficient web solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus on full stack development gives me the opportunity to work on
          all facets of a web project, from frontend design and implementation
          to database management and backend performance optimisation. This
          variety of tasks keeps me challenged and motivated to push my limits
          every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the digital world by
          creating impactful and functional web experiences that improve
          people's lives.
